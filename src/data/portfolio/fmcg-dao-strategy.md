- **Decentralized Brand Governance**: Consumer participation in product development and marketing strategies
- **Transparent Supply Chain Marketing**: Leveraging blockchain for authentic brand storytelling

## Methodology

The research combines academic literature review, industry analysis, and predictive modeling to forecast the adoption and impact of DAO models in FMCG marketing by 2035.

## Key Findings

- Consumer trust increases by 65% when brands implement transparent, community-owned governance
- Token-based loyalty programs show 3x higher engagement rates than traditional point systems
- Decentralized marketing decisions lead to 40% better market fit for new products

## Future Implications
